**Aritistic Turtle Project - Colorful Circle Art with Turtle Graphics**

This is a fun Python code that lets you create mesmerizing circle patterns using the Turtle graphics library. You can make colorful, eye-catching designs by playing with the parameters in the code!

**Prerequisites**

You don't need any special installations for this project. Python comes with the turtle library built-in.

**Getting Started** 

To make some cool circle art, follow these steps:
1. Open Python.
   
2. Copy and paste the code into a Python script.
   
3. Customize your art by changing the numbers in the draw_picture function call at the bottom of the script. Here's what each number does:

    size: The size of the starting circle.
   
    repeat: How many times the pattern repeats.
   
    num_circles: The number of circles in each pattern.
   
    decrease_amount: How much the circle size decreases each time.

Run the script and watch the **magic** happen!

Click on the Turtle graphics window to close it when you're done.

**Play Around**

You can get creative with the size, repeat, num_circles, and decrease_amount values. Try different combinations to see what kind of art you can come up with.

Feel free to change the colors too! In the colors list, you can pick your own shades to create a unique color palette. Here is a great link on github to see different colours understood by Python: https://github.com/paztronomer/blog/blob/master/code/p01_python_colors/named_colors.png 

This project is all about having fun and being creative. It's perfect for making colorful, funky designs and showing off your artistic side.

Enjoy making your own Turtle circle art! :)
